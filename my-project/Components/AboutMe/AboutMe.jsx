            </div>
            <p>Prior to studying at the School of Code my studies evolved around
                Art and Design, and then Psychology. During the bootcamp I found
                a true passion for coding which has only grown over time. I have
                experience of working with people from all walks of life and have
                gained the ability to work within a team and in an agile framework.
                Through the School of Code, I have developed both leadership and
                team work skills and the ability to problem solve and come up with
                solutions. I am committed, hard working, pro-active and passionate
                and am ready to contribute to a companies successes.
